# Graffiti-Removal

This is a coding challenge I did for a company that asks the user to input an alderman's last name, month and year and returns the aldermans full name, ward number, and graffiti removal requests for that month for the city of Chicago.

* It uses the City of Chicago's "Chicago Data Portal" Website hosted at https://data.cityofchicago.org/

* Ruby version 5.1

* I used bootstrap_form, dotenv-rails, soda-ruby, and breadcrumbs_on_rails gems to help create the page.

* It uses a postgresql database hosted with heroku at http://graffiti-removal.herokuapp.com/
